# AWD Link Shortener

## By: [Vignesh Joglekar](https://vigneshjoglekar.com)

----------



This is the initial version of the link shortening service created and interactively developed during an [Aggie Web Developers](https://aggiedevelopers.com) Advanced Workshop on modern Full-Stack applications.

The workshop was taught originally on November 4th.

The original codebase is available on the `main` branch, with the codebase that was created during the workshop itself available on the `workshop` branch (soon after the workshop).

The link to the recording of the workshop itself is available in the spreadsheet on the [AWD Slack](https://https://join.slack.com/t/aggiewebdevelopers/shared_invite/zt-gimqeifl-e1GQ59QsIBOk8JO4EYVAIA)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or issues running the codebase!

## Install & Run

4. Run `yarn start` or `yarn dev` to run the production or development scripts, respectively.
