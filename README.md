# AWD Link Shortener

## By: [Vignesh Joglekar](https://vigneshjoglekar.com)

----------



This is the new version of the link shortening service created and interactively developed during an [Aggie Web Developers](https://aggiedevelopers.com) workshop as a primer to AWD's project template & stack.

The workshop was taught originally on September 14th 2021.

The original codebase is available on the `new-version` branch, with the codebase that was created during the workshop itself available on the `new-version-live` branch (soon after the workshop).

The link to the recording of the workshop itself is available in the [AWD Discord](https://discord.gg/D3byBkExFC)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or issues running the codebase!

## Install & Run

1. [Node.js](https://https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14.x required)
2. Run `npm i` in the cloned directory to install dependencies (only the first time)
3. Run `npm run start` to run the development script.

## License

MIT - Feel free to use this codebase for anything really, but do bear in mind that the original version was made in about 2 hours, so no promises on any longevity or lack of bugs in either version!
